# BILD 5 Lecture 1
- ## 1/6

## Why Science?

- Data Analysis and Design for Biologists
- Goal of science:
	- The goal of science is to observe the universe and discover how and why phenomena happen and work together based on evidence.
- Science is a philosophy
	- **Goal**: To understand the universe
	- **Understand**: Describe and *predict*
- Most to least scientific ranking:
	- F, A, D, C, B, E
	- If you break a mirror, you will have seven years of bad luck.
		- Testable hypothesis - deductive
	- Appeal to authority = less scientific
	1. Rate of acceleration (inductive)
	2. Living things - cells
	3. Break a mirror = bad lack
	4. Flat earth?
	5. Nobel prize - Vitamin C
	6. Bible
- Set of repeated steps
- Two forms of reasoning to build a simplified model of the universe
	- Deductive Reasoning
		- Hypothesis testing
		- Conclusion reached when no other viable option
		- Experimental design
		- Stat analysis
		- Null hypothesis
			- Falsify one statement (null)
			- Leaves with a single statement to describe universe
			- Use numbers to describe measurement
				1. G=9.8
				2. G/=/9.9
				- Falsify #1
				- Left with #2
	- Inductive Reasoning
		- Created from deductive reasoning
			- series of experiments/observations
		- Constantly updated w new info
		- Scientific Models of universe
			- Periodic Table
				- Make predictions about universe based on elements
			- Physics
			- Evolution
			- Climate, tectonics
			- Big Bang
		- Model == simplification
		- Every model = wrong
			- Make changes
- All scientific models = wrong, but useful
	- Modify models
	- With incoming data
		- Inert gases --> Noble gases
		- Make bonds
		- Xenon poisoning
		- Take current models of universe
			- Break, change them, find where wrong
		- Science is not collection of facts
		- Accept foundational uncertainty
		- Math has to be internally consistent
			- Science does not
			- Scientific models not perfect
				- how well it predicts
- Measure how wrong a model is
	- **Error**
	- Use statistics
- This week assignments:
	1. 2 pre-course surveys - Sunday
		- Extra credit - 30 minutes
	2. Section Assignment - Sunday
		- R Programming
	3. Theory Quiz - Canvas (Sunday)
		- Lecture
