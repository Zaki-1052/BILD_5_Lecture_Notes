# BILD 5 Lecture 25
- ## 3/7
	- ## Experimental Design
	- ## Ethical Responsibility

## Humanitarian ethics in science: 

### Human Subjects

- Beyond our responsibility as scientists extends our responsibility as humans
	- Minimize risk
		- Institutional Review Boards (IRB)
			- approve ethical studies
	- Informed consent
		- No individual capable of giving consent may be enrolled in a study without that consent
		- Aims, Methods, Funding, Conflicts of Interest, Research Institutions, Benefits, Risks, Discomforts, Post-study Provisions
	- Guarded privacy
		- Is there any way to identify participants?
	- World Medical Association: 
		- Declaration of Helsinki
			- not placebo
				- old drug vs. new drug
### Apply these principals to a good experimental design:
- A researcher is interested in a new drug to treat leukemia. 
	- You think this drug will increase WBC in individuals suffering from this type of bone marrow cancer. 
- How would you design an experiment that would be statistically sound, but, more importantly, ethically responsible?
- What would your treatment groups be?
	- old drug + new drug
- Who would have access to the information about who was on which treatment?
	- primary physician
- What would you tell study participants?
	- everything under "informed consent"

### Putting science above people
- Even when our science is not about humans, we must ask ourselves;
- What is the unseen cost of this research?
- Does the benefit to humanity outweigh the cost?
- What should *the pursuit of virtue and knowledge* cost?

#### A real example for me:
- Mauna Kea, Hawaii
- Excellent spot for viewing the cosmos
- Sacred site for Hawaiian culture and religion
- For decades the people of Hawaii have protested and tried to protect this mountain, with little success until very recently

#### Think about a lab class you have taken or a lab you have worked inâ€¦
- #### What was the unseen cost of your research?
