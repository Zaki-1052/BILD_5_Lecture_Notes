## Turning Biological Questions into Statistical Hypotheses

### Step 1
- ##### **Before we collect data**:
##### Scientific Cycle
![[scientificCycle.png]]

### Hypothesis

1. Initial Observation
	- generated hypothesis
2. Research Question
3. Statistical Hypothesis
	- hypothesis not important
	- should create itself
#### Notes
- getting better at asking questions of the universe
	- journey of science
	- turning questions into testable hypotheses
	- testing w experimentation
- ask better research questions
	- turn into more complex models of the universe

#### Initial Observation
- Identify the area of biology
	- “Am I proficient in this discipline to be able to create new information”
- Find a gap in our understanding
	- Literature review
	- Scientists will publish what they think the unanswered questions are
##### Notes
- build a better model of the universe based on prior understanding
	- bio knowledge is observation
	- identify a true hole in model/understanding
	- find gaps in understanding
		- literature review
		- seminar/conference
			- unanswered questions
- not a novel hypothesis
	- works through effort
	- add more info to model
		- degrees give authority to say whether understand where holes of current understanding in science domain are
#### Research Question
- **What are we interested in?**
	- ###### The Research Question
		- A specific, answerable question
			- clear possible answer
			- singe statement about the universe
		- We do not (currently) have the answer to
	- ###### **A good research question**:
		- How do gray whales make the journey from the Arctic to Baja each year?
			- **Inductive**
				- no - not good
					- too broad
					- would require entire model of understanding whales
					- not a good research question
					- good scientific question
						- build inductive model
						- lab, observation and experiment
					- can't be answered with a single statement
				- questions impossible to answer
					- why/how
					- infinite layer
					- smaller questions
					- reason for job
						- expand scope of understood universe
							- single dot

##### Inductive vs. Deductive
- ###### **A good research question is _deductive_**
	- simpler questions used to inform inductive models of the universe
- ###### **Inductive**:
	- How do gray whales make the journey from the Arctic to Baja each year?
- ###### **Deductive**: 
	- How fast are gray whales?
		- speed
	- What is the caloric requirement for female gray whales on the journey north?
		- energy required
	- What is the leading cause of failure (death) along the voyage?
		- failure rate of migrations
	- (infinite questions)
- **A good research question is *deductive***.
	- not overarching
	- should be simple
	- answer stated in a single sentence
		- answer in a single equation
- good deductive question has a specific hypothesis
#### Statistical Hypothesis
- An **answer** to your research question:
	- The Hypothesis
- Biological Hypothesis:
	- Answer to your research question
	- Proposed mechanism for how the universe works
		- not the answer to a biological research question
		- trying to justify a research question within the current inductive model
		- Not an "If...Then" statement
			- involves mechanism of how universe works
			- for inductive models
		- want a yes or no answer:
- Statistical Hypothesis
	- The shape or pattern of the data
	- A paired statement, where one or the other are correct:
		- Null Hypothesis
			- H<sub>0</sub>
		- Alternate Hypothesis 
			- H<sub>A</sub>
		- (a good research question is answered with a statistical hypothesis pair)
			- one of these two statements are correct
				- but both statements together contain all possible outcomes of the universe
				- if three statements:
					- can't tell truth through falsification of one statement
				- must be only two outcomes:
					- the event occurred or it did not occur
						- if can prove it occurred, can disprove it did not occur
							- and vice versa
			- need only test/falsify one of them
				- (since only two statements)
				- only ever test the null
			- goal:
				- answer a good research question by using probability or likelihood to test one of these statements
			- probability of my observations about the universe
				- given the null hypothesis is true
			- universe:
				- has null and hypothesis
				- using statistics and experimentation
				- make observations about the universe
				- collect data designed to answer research question
					- test null hypothesis
				- ask:
					- what was the probability of getting data if null was in fact true
				- example:
					- if believe Mu (true mass) = 13
					- but get X bar = 13.5
					- probability of getting this average if the null is true
				- cutoff:
					- .05
				- probability of getting observation if null is true is 5% or less:
					- reject the null
	- Statistical test to examine the likelihood that the null is true
		- If it is so unlikely that the null is true, we accept the alternate hypothesis
			- must be only two outcomes
			- the event occurred or did not occur
			- pair of statements
			- disproving one proves the other
			- 
$$
P(Obs | H_o \dot True)
$$
- Probability of getting data if null was true
	- reject the null if percentage < 0.05
	- create research question...
- notes:
	- create a research question that can be answered with one of two statements
	- then make observations about the universe associated with that statement
		- measure cat mass, average cat mass compare
	- probability of getting observations if null is true
	- and if probability is 5% or less
		- reject null
		- and support alternate

##### Null vs Alternate Hypothesis
- ###### **Statistical Hypothesis: Null vs Alternate**
- ###### **Research Question: Example**
	- Is the caloric demand on female grey whales migrating with calf different from those who are not?
		- are new mothers spending more energy in migration than non-new mothers
- **Null Hypothesis**:
	- A statement of no pattern or difference in the data
	- There is no difference in the mean proportional mass loss between female gray whales who have and do not have calves.
		- average caloric intake of those without calf is equal to those with calf
		- measure same animals post-partum:
			- equal, no difference
	- $$\bar{x}_{no\,calf} = \bar{x}_{calf}$$
	- $$\Delta \bar{x} = 0$$
		- difference in animals over time (== 0)
- **Alternate Hypothesis**:
	- A statement of pattern or difference in the data
	- There is a difference in the mean proportional mass loss between female gray whales who have and do not have calves.
		- average mass loss of whales with calf is not equal to the average mass loss of whales without calf
	- $$\bar{x}_{no\,calf} \neq \bar{x}_{calf}$$
	- $$\Delta \bar{x} \neq 0$$
		- difference in means between these two groups is not equal to zero
	- t-tests types:
		- not quite identical statements
		- depends on how whales were measured
		- pair of statements contains all possible outcomes of the universe
			- difficult to test the negative
			- p-values test the null
				- null is a single statement of equality
					- either true or false
			- either reject that null or fail to reject that null
	- Even if some of the ways an alternate hypothesis would be perplexing to the model, do not set up a statistical hypothesis pair that does not contain all possible outcomes
		- need to maintain in alternate space
		- WRONG:
			- ~$$~~\bar{x}_{no\,calf} < \bar{x}_{calf}~~$$~
		- No **directional** alternate hypotheses
			- our alternate hypotheses don't deserve directionality even if it makes sense with our inductive model of the universe
				- biological hypothesis = predictions about data
					- don't -- just measure data, don't predict it
			- might have some prediction about directionality
				- with calf, spend more energy (feed during migration)
				- sometimes goal of science is to throw out current inductive model and to propose something new based on our evidence
			- alternate hypothesis must contain all other possibilities not contained in the null
				- never work here with directional alternate hypotheses
- **This pair of statements comprises all possible outcomes of the data**
#### Practice
- RQ1: (good deductive question)
	- Is there a difference in speed of whale between northbound and southbound migration?
		- are migration speeds the same or different based on directions they're travelling
		- Null Hypothesis:
			- The difference in speed between northbound and southbound whales is equal
- RQ2:
	- Is there a difference in speed of whale between northbound and southbound migration?
		- Null Hypothesis:
			- The difference in speed between northbound & southbound whales is **not** equal
				- single statement that could account for all other possibilities of whales travelling north and south
					- average velocity of northbound whales would not be equal to south
						- used averages/statistics
						- estimates of true parameters
							- can't measure it
						- statistics are inputs of null and alternate
						- not single observations/datum
						- average, correlation, slope
							- inputs to statistical null and alternate hypotheses
- ##### **Takeaways**:
	- ***Null** Hypothesis* has an **equal** sign (***equality***)
		- statement of equality
		- no difference
		- single testable statement
		- when things are **equal**
			- == **null**
		- test a statement of equality
	- ***Alternate** hypothesis* has a **does not equal** sign (***inequality***)
		- statement of **inequality** = **alternate** hypothesis
##### Notes
- problems:
	- don't know how measure speed, units, etc
- more specific we can make our research question, the easier this process becomes
	- is there a difference in speed measured in kilometers / per hour between a population of whales travelling north and a population of whales travelling south
		- ask does the average kilometers per hour of the northbound whales equal the average kilometers per hour of the southbound whales
			- can get very specific 
			- more specific
				- easier it is to make our null and alternate hypothesis pair
				- easier to fathom the experiment that would be required to test that question

### Summary
- A good research question:
	- Answerable
	- Deductive
		- not inductive
		- multiple deductive questions in an experiment
		- every figure/p-value is the representation from a single deductive question
	- Fills a hole in a current inductive model
	- A statistical hypothesis pair can be built
		- can you build a pair of statements that contain all answers to this question
- A good statistical hypothesis pair
	- Contains all possible outcomes of the universe for that question
	- The Null is a testable statement of equality
	- Build equations that represent the null and alternate
		- know what you're measuring
		- be able to state null and alternate hypothesis
		- with an equal sign and a not equal sign
