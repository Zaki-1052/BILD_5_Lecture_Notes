## Ethical Experimental Design

### Science Ethics
#### Intro
> [!Quote]
> "I said: 'O my brothers, who have reached the west, through a thousand dangers, do not deny the brief vigi, your senses have left to them, experience of the unpopulated world beyond the Sun. Consider your origin: you were not made to live like brutes, but to **follow virtue and knowledge**.' With this brief speech I made my companions so eager for the voyage, that I could hardly have restrained them, and turning the prow towards morning, we made wings of our oars for that foolish flight, always turning south."
> 
- Dante (1320) *Inferno*, Canto XXVI. 
	- Ulysses to Dante on how he tricked his crew into following him into ruin
#### Morally responsible science
- “to **follow virtue and knowledge**”
	- virtue = truth
		- truth cannot be achieved
		- because all models are wrong
		- allure of truth
	- truth & knowledge
- We need to recognize the draw that information has over us
- What price are we willing to pay for discovery?
	- Statistical ethics
	- Humanitarian ethics
### Statistical Ethics
#### Lie with Numbers
- While numbers don’t lie, it is very easy to lie with numbers
	- Pseudo-replication
		- standard error much smaller if bigger sample size
			- squared in denominator
			- saying more about the universe
	- Fabrication of data
	- Modifying data in a dataset
	- Early termination of a project
		- stopping when get biased results
	- Altering the data collection mid-measurement
	- Misuse of statistical tests
#### Issues
- Lets identify some issues:
	- A researcher is collecting survey data in a community.
		- She selects a block where she is comfortable walking because she knows many of the people living on the street.
		- No one seems to be home at four houses on her route. She does not record the addresses and does not return at a later time to try to find residents at home.
		- She skips four houses on her route because she is running late for an appointment. When she gets home, she fills in the forms by selecting random answers from other residents in the neighborhood.
	- Identify the errors made.
- Errors:
	- -
#### Real Example
- *Real Example*
- Famous (now infamous) social psychologist, Diederik Stapel
	- A two year investigation found a pattern of falsified data
	- 55 papers and 10 Ph.D. dissertations
	- “It was a quest for aesthetics, for beauty—instead of the truth”
		- creating datasets, which largely confirmed the prior expectations,
		- altering data in existing datasets,
		- changing measuring instruments without reporting the change,
		- and misrepresenting the number of experimental subjects.
			- pseudo-replication
- The investigation revealed that he should have been caught earlier, but his peers were not looking into the details of his statistical analysis.
- Notes:
	- not a quest for the truth
		- want to make tiny improvements to models we know are wrong
	- social science:
		- change the questions (measurements)
	- appeal to authority isn't scientific

### Humanitarian Ethics
- **Humanitarian ethics in science**:
#### Human Subjects
- Beyond our responsibility as scientists extends our responsibility as humans
	- Minimize risk
		- Institutional Review Boards (IRB)
	- Informed consent
		- No individual capable of giving consent may be enrolled in a study without that consent
		- Aims, Methods, Funding, Conflicts of Interest, Research Institutions, Benefits, Risks, Discomforts, Post-study Provisions
	- Guarded privacy
		- Is there any way to identify participants?
	- World Medical Association: Declaration of Helsinki
#### Priorities
- **Putting science above people**:
-  Even when our science is not about humans, we must ask ourselves;
	- What is the unseen cost of this research?
		- Does the benefit to humanity outweigh the cost?
			- What should *the pursuit of virtue and knowledge* cost?
- Think about a lab class you have taken or a lab you have worked in…
	- What was the unseen cost of your research?
		- -
### Notes
- TA note: 
	- ask for coffee w prof
		- programming language portfolio 
		- and how to be TA for bild 4/5
		- also research/llm tools
